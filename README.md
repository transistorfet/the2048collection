The 2048 Collection
===================

###### *Started Jan 25, 2022*

While searching for a new fun project to work on, I started playing with a few
different languages that I've been meaning to learn and explore, which lead me
to writing simple 2048 games in some of those languages.  This is the
repository to house the different versions.  Each version is in its own
directory named according to the language it's implemented in.
